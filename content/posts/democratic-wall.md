The Commission designates a place for all of you Xavier Ateneans! Raise your concerns, problems, and issues that you think are relevant to the overall welfare of your college or even the entire campus. Visit the Magis Atrium from today (February 28, 2024) until Saturday (March 2, 2024) and write them up in the democratic wall. For every question, you get to have one Botar sticker. Let your voice be heard, Ka-Atenista!
