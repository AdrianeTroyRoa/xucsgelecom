The XU CSG Electoral Commission released a guide for registering political parties for the upcoming Botar Atenista 2024. In contrast with the official resolution, this guide was simplified and posted at Facebook (which can be accessed via this [link](https://www.facebook.com/100064500467865/posts/739678414858834/)). The registration started on December 16, 2023, and will end on January 19, 2024 at exactly 6:00 PM. Below is the link for the Google Form submission:
